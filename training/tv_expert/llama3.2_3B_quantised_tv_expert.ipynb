The purpose of a J-cut is to cut from one action to the next, often to show a change in location or to break up a long sequence of shots. This technique is particularly useful in documentary filmmaking, where the narrative flow may be interrupted by time jumps or changes in setting.

It is a crucial step in post-production that involves adjusting the color palette, brightness, and overall look of the image. Color grading is used to achieve a specific aesthetic or mood, and to prepare the image for the final output. In film and television, color grading is used to create a consistent look across multiple episodes, while in commercial and advertising, it is used to grab the viewer's attention and make a lasting impression. There are several types of color grading, including primary color grading, which involves adjusting the brightness and saturation of an image; secondary color grading, which involves adjusting the color temperature and hue of an image; and fine-tuning grading, which involves making subtle adjustments to an image. Color grading can be done using various tools and software, including color grading software, such as DaVinci Resolve, or manually using a color grading tool, such as a color wheel. Color grading is a critical step in the post-production process, and it requires a deep understanding of color theory and the ability to make informed creative decisions.<|eot_id|>\n"]}],"source":["FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model) # Enable native 2x faster inference\n","\n","messages = [\n","    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is color grading used for? be very detailed as i dont understand the subject\"},\n","]\n","inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n","    messages,\n","    tokenize = True,\n","    add_generation_prompt = True, # Must add for generation\n","    return_tensors = \"pt\",\n",").to(\"cuda\")\n","\n","from transformers import TextStreamer\n","text_streamer = TextStreamer(tokenizer, skip_prompt = True)\n","_ = model.generate(input_ids = inputs, streamer = text_streamer, max_new_tokens = 2000,\n","                   use_cache = True, temperature = 1.5, min_p = 0.1)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"NGK6Npy-n9eU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uMuVrWbjAzhc"},"source":["<a name=\"Save\"></a>\n","### Saving, loading finetuned models\n","To save the final model as LoRA adapters, either use Huggingface's `push_to_hub` for an online save or `save_pretrained` for a local save.\n","\n","**[NOTE]** This ONLY saves the LoRA adapters, and not the full model.
